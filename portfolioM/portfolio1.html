            <h4>Bca Student</h4>
            <p>I’m someone who values a good balance between work and relaxation. I believe in getting things done, but I also think it’s important to take my time and not rush through life.  I’m naturally someone who enjoys a slower pace, but I’m also committed to putting in the effort when it matters most.  I like to keep things straightforward and stress-free.</p>
